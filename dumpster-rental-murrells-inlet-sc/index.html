Choosing the Right Dumpster Size<h2>

We understand that waste size and weight vary across different cleanup projects. That’s why we came prepared in the dumpster rental scene in Murrells Inlet, SC with a wide variety of dumpster sizes. With so many options, choosing the one that suits your project can get confusing. However, when trying to choose a dumpster, three key factors should be considered:<list>



Type of Waste: Heavily dense and large waste items require heavy-duty roll-off dumpsters, while lighter waste that isn’t too large is suitable for our rear-load and front-load dumpsters.^^



Type of Project: Once the waste begins accumulating, you may find it tricky to choose the right dumpster. For regular waste from offices, kitchens, or small home remodeling tasks, a rear-load or front-load dumpster will work just fine. But for bigger jobs like full home renovations, major construction, or demolition you’ll need a roll-off dumpster.^^



Waste Load: An easy way to choose the right dumpster is by considering both the size and weight of your waste. For lighter, bulky items like furniture or household junk, a roll-off dumpster is ideal, as it offers plenty of space perfect for cleanouts and renovations. For heavier debris like concrete, bricks, or shingles, a smaller roll-off dumpster is a better choice, as it’s built to handle dense materials without damage. Front-load dumpsters, on the other hand, are best for ongoing, smaller-scale commercial waste, and not for heavy construction loads.

Roll-off Dumpster Rental in Murrells Inlet, SC<h2>

For large and heavy-bulky waste, our roll-off dumpsters are great. They’re great accumulators for materials like roofs, bricks, trees, concrete, large furniture, and asphalt.

We offer roll-off dumpsters in the following sizes:<list>

10-YARD DUMPSTER: Ideal for light household, remodeling, or renovation cleanups. It holds up to 1.5 tons of waste.^^





12-YARD DUMPSTER: Great for heavy household or yard cleanups and renovation waste. It can handle items like furniture, wood, and drywall.^^





15-YARD DUMPSTER: Designed to hold solid and bulky waste from construction or landscaping. It handles dry concrete, ceramic tiles, bricks, dirt, asphalt, stucco, and plaster. It can hold up to 2 tons of waste.^^





20-YARD DUMPSTER: Perfect for heavy construction debris and demolition projects, with a capacity of up to 3 tons of waste.^^





40-YARD DUMPSTER: Best for the biggest cleanup jobs, from large households to construction sites. It can hold up to 5 tons of waste material.

Waste Load: An easy way to choose the right dumpster is by considering both the size and weight of your waste. For lighter, bulky items like furniture or household junk, a roll-off dumpster is ideal, as it offers plenty of space perfect for cleanouts and renovations. For heavier debris like concrete, bricks, or shingles, a smaller roll-off dumpster is a better choice, as it’s built to handle dense materials without damage. Front-load dumpsters, on the other hand, are best for ongoing, smaller-scale commercial waste, and not for heavy construction loads.

Dohner Dumpster Rental Commercial and Roll-off Dumpsters<h2> 

While most dumpster companies in Murrells Inlet, SC specialize mainly in renting out roll-off dumpsters for cleaning up larger and bulky waste, Dohner Dumpster Rental is one of the few dumpster rental services in Murrells Inlet, SC that offers both roll-off and commercial dumpsters (i.e., front-load and rear-load dumpsters). This ensures that everyone can move their waste to the landfill as soon as possible, rather than waiting for it to pile up before taking action.<list>

Roll-off Dumpster: Our roll-off dumpsters are designed to conveniently hold large and heavy waste, and they are built with durable materials that allow them to securely contain this waste until it’s disposed of at the landfill. We offer five different models like 10-yard, 12-yard, 15-yard, 20-yard, and 40-yard, each with its own specific weight limit.^^

Our roll-off dumpsters are suitable for handling tough materials like old furniture, bricks, large tree branches, gravel, concrete, garage clutter, and other heavy debris.^^

Commercial Dumpster: Our commercial dumpsters are of two types; rear-load and front-load, to help support your everyday waste disposal needs. These dumpsters collect general daily trash such as paper, plastics, napkins, disposable utensils, cleaning supplies, bags of garbage, and other mixed waste.^^



Our front-load dumpsters are designed for easy and convenient disposal, making them perfect for open spaces around businesses. On the other hand, our rear-load dumpsters are great for tight or narrow areas where space is limited but a dumpster is still needed. 



No matter your space or trash volume, we have a commercial dumpster that fits just right.

<review>

I'm sending a big thank you to your team for helping make the construction remodeling project I managed a success. They played a huge role in making sure we didn’t have waste piling up and blocking our work areas. The dumpsters were placed in the most accessible spots, which made it easy for us to dispose of debris quickly. And anytime one got filled, they were right on time with a replacement. I really appreciate the support.<h2>- Albert Murphy

While managing demolition projects in several California cities, Dohner Dumpster Rental took the stress out of tracking down dumpsters in different locations to handle the debris. They provided the right dumpster for each site, making my job smooth. Which I really appreciated!<h2>- Golding Luke

The dumpster at my restaurant used to overflow with trash, which was really frustrating. Dohner Dumpster Rental helped solve the problem by assessing my needs and providing an 8-yard dumpster that holds all our weekly waste without overflowing. They empty it on schedule, and it’s made a big difference.<h2>- Jack Wilson
